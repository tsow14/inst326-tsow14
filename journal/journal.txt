 This week AI has my assitant in gathering information for my classes and assignments. 
I had recently discovered a website called notebook.lm. It is an AI assistant that breaks 
down the information from readings and articles then allows you to ask questions straight from the text.
The most helpful part about it is that it only pulls from the text information. It will even cite the part 
of the text that it is talking about.

a handle on:

Entry #2 - 9/18

On this day, I was invited to the Pensa Bible Study by some of my friends. As I am Muslim, I was very interested in 
getting to know more about Christianity. Going into the study, I brought notes but then they started reading bible verses.
I asked Chat to pull up the verses for me as well as ask for similiarites from the Quran to see where our lessons and understandings align.
Genuinely it was helpful to be able to pull the verses in real time and compare them to the Quran

Entry #3 - 9/19

Jummuah is a special friday prayer for Muslims. We are asked to pray in congregation at the Mosque, but due to school some of
us are unable to make it to the Mosque at the time. A group of Muslims in my class decided to pray Jummuah in ESJ, and with every prayer there is
a Khutbah where one person speaks on a topic and connects it to verses in the quran. Before the prayer, I asked Chat to help me build one.
I took notes and adapted it into my own Khutbah along with personal anecdotes and prayers.

I was listening to songs that were in my parent's langugage "Wolof" and was trying to find the lyrics. I got curious and wanted to ask Chat

Entry #5 - 9/23

On this day, I had attended the Bethel Campus Fellowship Bible Study with my friends. It was a QA session with
thier panel so that people could learn more about Christianity. Since I'm not super knowledgable, I used Chat to help
me form questions and to answer questions I had as they talked. It as truly eye-opening and I was able to use Chat
to cross reference the information I knew about Islam with the information I was gaining.

Going through the exercercises for this week, I had to refresh my memory on how to work through lists as 
a lot of the functions had to deal with iteration. Chat was able to give a quick little crash course, and 
it really helped as I felt myself flowing through the excercises afterwards.

I was invited to my friends birthday suprise, and I wanted to introduce a game to them. It's called "Middle Ground".
Its a game where people argue controversial topics and can sub out the representative for the argument if they feel like
they are not doing well. To be able to get some topics, I asked ChatGPT to develop some topics for me and we
were able to get into heavy discourse.

Recently, I've had the opportunity to become the Special Events Chair in my program. As part of that role, I am to plan social workshops that
my cohort would be excited to participate in. The idea I came up with was a two segments: Family Feud and Just Dance. To allow for a more hands on 
activity as well as something people can enjoy while sitting down. While creating it, I asked Chat to help me develop it into a better and organized form.

I've been playing Basketball since the beginning of the semester, and as I play I just want to get better and better. In part of that, I started

has to be incremental.

For one of my assingments, we were told to go out into the world and take pictures of ICTS of Information and Communication Technologies. I was

Entry #14 - 10/20

One of my weekly assingments is develop an exit ticket for the things we learned in class, althought I felt as though my notes were lacking.
I chose to ask copilot to break down the 5 Ws for each topic I was going to talk about so that I could enhance my exit ticket. It was very helpful as
I proceeded to ask about the history of each as well.

There was a song that I found on Tiktok but I could not find it again thinking I had it in my likes or favorites. It was genuinely bothering my soul. 
I had to go to ChatGPT to give me a list of songs that it had released in the recent months to see if I could potentially find it, but it was just not
possible.

I was buying clothes for the winter from a site that is based in the U.S, but they had outsourced their shipping to a differnt site.
It was unfamiliar so I decided to ask Chat how trustworthy the shipping source was. I used the same chatline to take a picture of a menu
that was in Spanish and I asked it to translate the parts of the menu that I could not understand.
