/* This week AI has my assitant in gathering information for my classes and assignments. 
I had recently discovered a website called notebook.lm. It is an AI assistant that breaks 
down the information from readings and articles then allows you to ask questions straight from the text.
The most helpful part about it is that it only pulls from the text information. It will even cite the part 
of the text that it is talking about.
